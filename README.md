# react-redux-parcel-flat-file

A very basic beginner friendly flat file react+redux+parcel made easy

**What's inside?**

* `parcel-bundler`
* `react`
* `react-dom`
* `redux`
* `react-redux`
* `prop-types`
* `babel-preset-react-app`

## Getting started

Clone and install deps

```
git clone git@github.com:dastagirkhan/react-redux-parcel-flat-file.git
cd react-redux-parcel-flat-file
npm install or yarn
npm start or yarn start
```

Then open `http://localhost:1234` and edit `index.js` and press save. Parcel
will automagically hot reload you files whenever you make changes.

## Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

This will compile your JS and copy your `index.html` to the `dist` folder which
you can deploy wherever as a good ol' webpage.
